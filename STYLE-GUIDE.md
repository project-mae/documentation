# Style Guide

In Project MAE, formatting and styling is important. Pursuant to this, all code and text files will
be subject to style guidelines and requirements. Any commits or pull-requests against any Project
MAE repository that does not adhere to the proper style may be rejected.

## General Guidelines
<!-- To Be Determined -->

Tabs should be preferred to spaces, as they can be dynamically resized at the user's preference.

## Swift

Swift code must be formatted with the
[`swift-format`](https://github.com/apple/swift-format#command-line-usa) tool.

## Markdown

Markdown code must be formatted by the style guide created by `markdownlint`. These rules may be
found at [the `markdownlint` GitHub repository](https://github.com/DavidAnson/markdownlint/blob/main/doc/Rules.md#md041).

All markdown text must be wrapped at 100 characters, except in the presence of inline URLs.
